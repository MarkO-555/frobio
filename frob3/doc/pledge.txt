With pixels bright and circuits humming,
To the Flag of COCO we stand,
A testament to joys of coding,
In the land of the 6809.

We pledge our love to lines of code,
Crafted with bits and bytes so true,
Where sprites dance free and music soars,
In games born vintage, ever new.

We hail the heroes of the past,
Who blazed a trail in silicon,
Their pixel dreams took form and flight,
On chips that powered our devotion.

From scrolling skies to dungeon deep,
Each world a canvas, vast and bold,
We celebrate the pioneers,
Whose stories in our hearts unfold.

So raise your joysticks, raise your keyboards,
Let CRTs illuminate the way,
With every line, with every byte,
For COCO, we pledge allegiance, this day!
