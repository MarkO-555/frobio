To run a Go web server on port 80 without root privileges, several approaches can be used:

;;;;;;;;;;

Using setcap:

This method grants the binary the capability to bind to privileged ports without full root access.

Code

    sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/your/binary

This command adds the cap_net_bind_service capability to the executable, allowing it to bind to ports below 1024, including port 80.

;;;;;;;;;;

Using authbind:

This utility allows specific users or groups to bind to specific ports.

Code

    sudo apt-get install authbind
    sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80
    sudo chmod 777 /etc/authbind/byport/80
    authbind --deep /path/to/your/binary

These commands install authbind, configure it to allow any user to bind to port 80, and then run the binary using authbind.
